<h2>There ought to be a law...</h2>
<p>This is a simple excercise for individuals, pairs, threes or whole group. The aim of the
activity is to suggest a new law, which reasons for it. The game can be extended into a 
clear-communications and writing excersise, by asking the participants to write the new 
law in clear trms that explain it absolutely with minimum leeway for misunderstanding or 
misinterpretation. The clearity of the writting can be testd by group questions and 
review. This exercise is particularly relevant for people who will benefit from individual 
candidates in ecruitment group sections. This activity can also benefit with responsibility 
for writing instructions and manuals.</p></article>

<h2>Flags</h2>
<p>There is a lot of flexibility in this activity. It can be used for individuals or teams of 
any sorts. The object of the exercisee is simply to design a flag that symbolizes the person
or the team (or group or department, etc.). Materials required are just some flip chart
sheets and colored pens and markers. The exercise can be used as a quick warm-up
or ic-breaker, say 10 minutes to create the flags, and a couple minutes each to present and review. 
A longer team or group activity, requiring 10-15 minutes of discussion, development 
of ideas, creation of the flag design, and then as much time as is necessary
to present and discuss the reasons and reactions.</p>

<p>When invited to express themselves in a completely new and different medium, 
people find it easier to really think about their qualities. The exercise is particularly 
useful to begin inter-departmental workshops. Teams have to think about to they 
stand for, how they wish to b seen, and other teams have a chance to see and undertand
collegues or other departments in a different way. As an exercise for work groups, this is a 
good prompt for debate within the team, and then afterwards between teams when flag designs are presented 
and reviewed. This exercise is also excellent as an individual activity for children and young 
people of all ages. It can also be used for pairs of threes of friends, boys groups, girls groups; the 
possibilities really are endless. As an alternate to include symbols and image icons, as well as colors 
and shapes.</p></article>
