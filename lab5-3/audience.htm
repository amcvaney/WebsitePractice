</h1></header>

<section>
<p>Before you start writing the content of your web site, you deciding, how your site will look, 
or make layout decisions, you should determine exactly who your target audience will be. 
A site designed for kids would have a completely different look and feel than a site designed 
to appeal to accountants, or other business professionals. The word usage, colors, graphics, content, 
navigation, and layout must be developed with the end user in mind. A web site that 
advertises businesses service should consists of a conservative color sheme with a 
scheme with a professional wording to appeal to its audience, however a website whose target audience is 
children would not be very successful with that same design plan.</p>
<p>In most cases, individuals can be grouped according to one or more of the 
categories listed below. A good web desiger will undrstand that ddifferent groups 
of people have different preferences and expectations and knowing how to utilize thoe differences 
will help you develope a much more successful site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Age
<li>Gender
<li>Religious groups
<li>Economic groups
<li>Geographic locations
<li>Interest and hobbies
</ul>
