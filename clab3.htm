<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Mathematics</strong></h3>
<p>If a person places a single coin on the first square of a chessboard, then places 
twice this number, or two coins, on the second square, twice this number again, or 
four coins on the third square, and so on until all sixty-fours square are covered, 
exactly 18,446,744,973,709,551,661 coins will be required to do the job - more than 
have been minted in the world since the beginning of recorded civilization.

<p>When one adds up the number of letters in the name of the playing cards - ace (3), 
two (3), three (5), four (4), six (3), seven (5), eight (5), nine (4), ten (3),

<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Inventions</strong></h3>
<p>The parachut was invented more than a hundred years before the airplane. It was 
the creation of Louis Lenarmand, who designed it in 1783 to save people who had 
jumped from burning buildings. In 1797 Jacques Gamerin gave a public exhibition of 
parachuting, descending 3000 feet from a balloon.
</p>
<p>The telephone was not invented by Alexander Graham Bell. Its first creator was a 
German, Philip Reis, who in 1861 made a primitive sending-receiving transmitter which 
he called the "telephone". Twelve years later Elisha Gray  completed a short-distance 
telephone comunication. Bell's invention, patented in March, 1876, was distinguished 
by the fact that is was the first sending-receiving mechanism over which the human 
voice could be transmitted.

vacuum cleaner.
</p>
<p>When the Apollo 12 astronauts landed on the moon, the impact caused the moon's 
surface to vibrate for fifty-five minutes. The vibrations were picked up the laboratory 
instruments, leading geologists to theorize that the moon's surface is composed of 
many fragile layers of rocks.
